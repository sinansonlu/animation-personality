# Towards Understanding Personality Expression via Body Motion
This repository contains our code and data for our work-in-progress article published in MASSXR 2024.

We label selected animation samples from two datasets:
- [Bandai-Namco-Research-Motiondataset](https://github.com/BandaiNamcoResearchInc/Bandai-Namco-Research-Motiondataset.git)
- [ZeroEGGS: Zero-shot Example-based Gesture Generation from Speech](https://github.com/ubisoft/ubisoft-laforge-ZeroEGGS.git)

- [ZeroEGGS_Study_Results.csv](ZeroEGGS_Study_Results.csv)
- [Bandai_Study_Results.csv](Bandai_Study_Results.csv)
